Explainable ML Exercise 6
This Jupyter Notebook (Explainable ML_exercise 6.ipynb) provides an example of using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the predictions of a machine learning model trained on a chocolate dataset.

Overview
In this exercise, we'll demonstrate how to:

Import necessary libraries and install SHAP.
Load and preprocess the chocolate dataset.
Train a RandomForestClassifier as a surrogate model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Use k-means to summarize the training data.
Explain model predictions using SHAP values.
Visualize SHAP summary plots for the entire test set.

Usage

Setup Environment: Ensure you have the required libraries installed. If not, use !pip install shap to install SHAP.

Load Data: The chocolate data is loaded from the flavors_of_cacao_new.csv file. It's preprocessed to handle categorical variables and prepare the target variable (Rating) as binary classes.

Train Model: We use a RandomForestClassifier as a surrogate model to predict chocolate ratings. The model is trained on the preprocessed training data.

Evaluate Model: The mean squared error is computed for both the training and testing datasets to evaluate model performance.

Summarize Training Data: We apply k-means clustering to summarize the training data into three clusters.

Explain Predictions: SHAP values are computed for the entire test set to explain model predictions.

Visualize SHAP Summary Plot: A summary plot is generated to visualize SHAP values for the entire test set, providing insights into feature importance.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP, matplotlib, numpy
